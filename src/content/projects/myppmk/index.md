## 💡 The Idea

This project was created for the [HackPPMK '25](https://hackppmk25.devpost.com/) hackathon, which had the theme "Enhancing digital connectivity between student communities." 

The initial challenge was to find a way to represent the complex web of relationships between various Malaysian student organizations in an intuitive format. We wanted to move beyond simple lists or directories and create something more engaging.

## 🚀 The Solution

MyPPMK is an interactive mind map that visualizes the ecosystem of Malaysian student communities. It provides a graph-based view where each organization is a "node" and the relationships between them are "edges." This approach, inspired by tools like Obsidian's graph view, allows users to explore and understand the connections between different groups in a fun and interactive way.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive Graph:** A dynamic and engaging mind map built with `vis-network-react`.
- **Detailed Information:** Clicking on any node reveals more information about that specific club or community.
- **Visual Connections:** Edges between nodes clearly illustrate the relationships and collaborations between different organizations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) for the user interface.
- **Data Visualization:** [vis-network-react](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network) to create the interactive graph.
- **Backend & Database:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for data storage and management.
