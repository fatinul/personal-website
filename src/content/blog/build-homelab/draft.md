# My Story

I bought a mini pc to be used as my personal gaming machine. Only lasted a week and I am not using it anymore
Some times went by, and now I am thinking to have my own personal server
It was quite overwhelming at first but I start to pickup the notch the more I dive into the whole homelabing

I am using proxmox to host bunch of container/vm like nextcloud (my first working container - I followed this youtube and its working wonder), next, I host jellyfin and rebrand it into tv.tinul with the help of my friend, Wari. I also host this website that you are reading right now

At first it was just a mini pc with no extra storage (I want to have a long term and a bigger storage for all the important things that I have saved) So, Later I bought a 2TB hard disk, I accidentally bought a wrong size (I bought a bigger one and my mini pc can't even power it). So I need to delay my project for a day to buy an external Hard disk to usb 3.0 rather than to use SATA. As long as it works, I'm fine.
